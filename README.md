# Overview

The Health and Fitness App is designed to provide users with a comprehensive toolset for tracking their health and fitness journey. As a software engineer, my goal in developing this app was not just to enhance my coding skills but also to create a product that encourages and facilitates a healthy lifestyle. This app allows users to log workouts, track diet, and view health statistics, making it easier to set and achieve personal fitness goals.

The app is user-friendly, with a simple interface that allows for quick navigation between different features. Users can start by creating a profile and then dive into logging daily meals, workouts, and tracking progress through visually informative charts.

This project was initiated to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting, integrating various aspects of software development, from UI design to database management, and to contribute positively to the well-being of its users.

# Development Environment

The app was developed using Android Studio, the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system. Android Studio provides a comprehensive array of tools for Android development, from code editing to debugging and testing, making it the ideal choice for this project.

The primary programming language used is Java, known for its portability, security, and robustness. Java is a popular choice for Android app development, offering a rich set of libraries and APIs that facilitated the creation of the app's features. Alongside Java, XML was used for designing the app's layout, and SQLite for database management, enabling data persistence for user profiles, workout logs, and dietary information.
